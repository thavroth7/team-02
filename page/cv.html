                            Your future employers have needs. If they're willing to hire you, it's because they think you’ll satisfy those needs.
                            
                             
                            
                            But what they also want is for you to actually enjoy working with them. They want your future job to feel rewarding to you—that way, they know you’re more likely to stay with them for a longer period of time.
                            
                             
                            
                            The third paragraph of the key to writing a perfect cover letter is showing the hiring manager why you want this job, not just any job. This is particularly important when writing an entry-level cover letter. Enthusiasm and passion help to prove you'll hit the ground running.

                    <h2>8. Add a Postscript</h2>
                    <span>All of the above sections are must-haves in a good cover letter format. But there’s one special trick you can use:

 

                        The postscript.
                        
                         
                        
                        Why is the “P.S.” so important? Because it's like a magnet for the hiring manager's eyes. It screams: “you cannot miss this information.”
                        
                         
                        
                        Use the postscript to tell the hiring manager about something impressive about your career (1), even if it’s not strictly related to the job opening.
                        
                         
                        
                        And say that you'd be happy to provide them with more details (2) if they find it interesting.</span>

                            <li>Thank you,</li>

                    <h2>8. Add a Postscript</h2>
                    <span>All of the above sections are must-haves in a good cover letter format. But there’s one special trick you can use:
                        The postscript.
                        Why is the “P.S.” so important? Because it's like a magnet for the hiring manager's eyes. It screams: “you cannot miss this information.”
                        
                         
                        
                        Use the postscript to tell the hiring manager about something impressive about your career (1), even if it’s not strictly related to the job opening.
                        
                         
                        
                        And say that you'd be happy to provide them with more details (2) if they find it interesting.</span>
